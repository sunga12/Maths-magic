        I&apos;m Sunga, a student in the Microverse Program.
        Using React, I&apos;ve created this SPA website consisting of three main pages
        that offer unique functionalities. If you are reading this, then you must be on
        the home page.
        The calculator page features a dynamic calculator built with
        React&apos;s powerful hooks like useState making it easy to perform
        various calculations. Lastly, the random quote page fetches inspiring quotes
        from the API Ninja service, using the useEffect Hook, providing fresh motivation
        with each page refresh. Thanks to React Router, navigation between these pages
        is seamless, ensuring a smooth user experience. Join me on this exciting journey
        as we explore the world of React-powered interactivity!

        I&apos;m thrilled to present this SPA website, showcasing my passion for development.
        Whether you&apos;re interested in performing calculations
        with the calculator, or seeking inspiration through quotes, there&apos;s something
        for everyone. Enjoy your time on my website, and let&apos;s embark on an exciting
        adventure together!
